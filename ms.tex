\section{Bayesian Inference}


\subsection{Bayes' Rule}
From the single-hypothesis version of Bayes' rule:
\begin{eqnarray}
P(H|D) &=& \frac{P(H)P(D|H)}{P(D)}
\end{eqnarray}
prove the version commonly used for a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive
hypotheses $\{H_1, H_2, ..., H_N\}$:
\begin{eqnarray}
P(H_i|D) &=& \frac{P(H_i)P(D|H_i)}{P(D)}\label{eq:bayes}
\end{eqnarray}
for all $i \in \{1, 2, ..., N\}$.

\subsection{Discrete parameter estimation}
You are a customs agent. Among other things, you are supposed to prevent
drugs being smuggled in packages sent into the country. A colleague finds a
package containing two toys. Let the number of toys containing drugs be
$\eta$. Clearly the value of $\eta$ is either 0, 1, or 2. You drill into
one of the toys and find that it does not have drugs.
Calculate the posterior distribution for $\eta$ given that the tested
toy did not contain drugs. Assume a (discrete) uniform prior, i.e.
$P(\eta=0) = P(\eta=1) = P(\eta=2) = 1/3$.

{\tiny Hint: Use Bayes' rule in the form of Equation~\ref{eq:bayes}
three times, and note they all have the same denominator.}

\subsection{Continuous parameter estimation}
An X-ray source emits photons at a steady rate, but since it's so distant, we
only pick up a few photons per second.
A standard probabilistic model for the arrival times of the photons is the
``Poisson process''. A specific prediction of this model is that, if the
expected number of photons in a given one second interval
is $\lambda$, the (discrete) probability distribution for the actual number of photons in that interval is a Poisson distribution:
\begin{eqnarray}
p(x | \lambda) &=& \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}
\end{eqnarray}
